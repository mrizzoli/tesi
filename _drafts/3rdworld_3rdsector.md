## Notes on the working paper from Johns Hopkins Comparative Nonprofict Sector Project
#### [see the paper online](/http://adm-cf.com/jhu/pdfs/CNP_Working_Papers/CNP_WP24.pdf)

Despite the increasing recognition of third sector organizations as part of economic growth and their preminent role in democratization processes and in welfare provision, the study and subsequently the comprehention of the inner mechanisms and specificities of nonprofit organizations [^this term is used interchangeably for all those activities who are part of the third sector, including fb-ngo, ngo and so on] remain poorly understood.

Three levels of study are recognized as not yet fully delevoped:

 * The basic *descriptive* information is lacking, as it seems that in the developing countries there is a systematic lack of recording of such activities.
 * On the *conceptual* level there is a scarce understanding of a multifarious landscape of organizations that encompass religious schools, human rights organizations grassroots  movements and many more. Approaching such a differentiated context requires proper analitycal tools, and the overuse of the categorization based on NGO vs Non-NGO even if someway useful might be misleading, especially in the under-representation of the role of "informal" or religion based organizations, thus preventing a proper comprehension.
 * The *theoretical* framework with which scholars approach the study of third sector in developing countries is mostly biased by its own origin in the study of the Western context, thus suffering from forms of "orientalization" and from scarcity and inadequacy of useful analytical categories.

Selection of case countries: criterias

* Low per capita income: one of the arguments ofthe aper is to understand how average income influence the development of third sector organizatios, and to pursue this goal countries in the lowest range of average per capita incoma are selected so to differentiate from westarn high average income countries. The idea is that *need* alone can't bolster the growth of such organizations, especially since financial, time and organizational resources and skills are needed. The leading theory for this is drawn from [@weisbrod1977]:
>such organizations are most likely to emerge not where resources are uniformly limited, but where heterogeneous needs emerge and some peoplehave the resources to resopond to these needs through joint action.

* Small Urban Middle Class: rurality is one of the criteria for selection of case studies, as urban population and middle class is considered to be directly correlated with the birth and growth of non profit institutions (to support this theory the aper quotes [@salamon1994] and [@moore1967]).

* Authoritarian political regimes: with the due differences every selected country had experienced some form of authoritarian regime, and this is another factor that influence negatively the development of third sector.
